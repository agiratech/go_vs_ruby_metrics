Agira (http://www.agiratech.com) team was solutioning for the situation where in to upload a set of complex csv data in to an ETL Database (PostgreSql).

We have made our hands dirty with the Ruby code first (sidekiq jobs).

But the situation demands for better performance and improved execution time.

To improvise for the situation and to have a efficient concurrency on the operations we have developed the code again in Golang.

No wonder, Golang performance is much better on the give situation.

#agiratech team want to ensure the  results are measured better, so we executed the same process in AWS boxes (c4.xlarge & c4.2xlarge.

Checkout for golang code in master branch and Ruby code in rails branch.

Happy Learning !!!!
